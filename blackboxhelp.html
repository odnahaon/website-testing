      	<p>Black Box is played on a two-dimensional grid. The object of the game
      	   is to discover the location of objects ("atoms") hidden within the
      	   grid, by the use of the minimum number of probes ("rays"). The atoms
      	   are hidden by the computer. The player designates where the ray enters
      	   the black box and the computer announces the result (a "hit", a
      	   "reflection", or a "detour/miss"). This result is then marked and the
      	   player uses these to deduce the position of the atoms in the black
      	   box. Below is an example of a game board.</p>

      	<h2><a name="h_rules">Rules</a></h2>
      	<p>Atoms interact with rays in three ways. A direct impact on an atom
      		by a ray is a "hit". Thus, ray 1 fired into the box configuration at
      		left strikes an atom directly, generating a "hit", designated by an "H".
      		A ray which hits an atom does not emerge from the box.</p>
      	<p><img src="resource/Hit.png" alt="Image example of a hit on an atom."></p>
      	<p>The interaction resulting from a ray which does not actually hit an
      		atom, but which passes directly to one side of the ball is called a
      		"deflection". The angle of deflection for this ray/atom interaction is
      		90 degrees. Ray 2 is deflected by the atom, exiting the box as shown.</p>
      	<p><img src="resource/Deflection.png" alt="Image example of a deflection on an atom."></p>
      	<p>The final type of interaction of a ray with an atom is a "reflection",
      		designated by an "R". This occurs in two circumstances. If an atom is at the
      		edge of the grid, any ray which is aimed into the grid directly beside it
      		causes a reflection.</p>
      	<p>Rays 3 and 4 would each generate a reflection,
      		due to the atom at the edge. Ray 5 would be a hit on the atom.</p>
      	<p><img src="resource/Reflection.png" alt="Image example of a reflection on an atom."></p>
      	<p>The other circumstance leading to a reflection is when two deflections
      		cancel out. In the grid, ray 6 results in a reflection due to its
      		interaction with the atoms in the grid.</p>
      	<p><img src="resource/DoubleDeflection.png"
      		alt="Image example of a double deflection on an atom."></p>
      	<p>There are also misses. Ray 7, for instance, interacts with no atoms
      	in the grid.</p>
      	<p><img src="resource/Miss.png" alt="Image example of a miss."></p>
      	<p>Rays that don't result in hits or reflections are called "detours".
      		These may be single or multiple deflections, or misses. A detour has an
      		entry and an exit location, while hits and reflections only have an entry
      		location for a hit (indicated by an "H") and a single entry/exit location
      		for a reflection (indicated by an "R"). Detours and misses are indicated
      		by a matching number/color pair at the entry and exit points.</p>
      	<p>Of course, more complex situations result when these behaviors
      		interact. Ray 8 results in two deflections, as does ray 9.</p>

      	<h2><a name="h_scr">Scoring</a></h2>
      	<p>Each entry and exit location counts as a point. Hits and reflections
      		therefore cost one point, while detours cost two points. When the seeker
      		guesses the location of the atoms in the grid, each misidentified atom
      		position costs five points. It is better to get a low score in this game.</p>
      	<p>Different atom positions lead to different average scores - normally 8-9
      	   for a four-ball game.</p>
